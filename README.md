A: Make sure you:
- Are logged into Bilibili
- Have provided the correct SESSDATA
- Have proper network connectivity
- Are not making too many requests in a short time

**Q: Is there a limit to how many followers I can export?**
A: The tool can handle any number of followers, but larger lists will take longer to export. The script includes appropriate delays to avoid rate limiting.
